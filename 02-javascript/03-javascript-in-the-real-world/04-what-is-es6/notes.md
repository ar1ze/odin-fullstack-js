# ❓ What is ES6?

### Introduction
This lesson explains what ES6 means and its implications in your code.

---
### 📝 Lesson Overview
* Describe what ES6 is.
* Describe the current ECMAScript release system.
* Explain some potential issues with browser support for newer JavaScript features.
* Explain what Babel is.

### 📜 ECMAScript
* **JavaScript** is a programming language that conforms to the **ECMAScript standard**.
* **ES6** is a version of JavaScript officially released in the summer of 2015.
* It included many new features that make writing JavaScript much easier and cleaner.

---
### 🗓️ Release Schedule
* After ES6, the naming scheme changed from version numbers (ES5, ES6) to release years.
* ES6 is also known as **ES2015**.
* ES7 is also known as **ES2016**, and so on.
* Versions are now released **annually** with a smaller set of additions, unlike the single large release of ES6.

### 🖥️ Browser Support
* **Problem:** It takes time for web browsers to implement new JavaScript features after they are released. A new feature might take a couple of years to be "widely available."
* **Impact:** If you write code using brand new features, it **will not run** in browsers that do not support it.
* **In the real world:** You can't control which browsers your customers use, so this becomes a concern.

---
### ⚙️ Babel
* **Solution:** **Babel** is a tool that **transpiles** (converts) your modern JavaScript code into code that older browsers can understand.
* **Configuration:** It can be set to meet specific targets, like minimum browser versions.
* **Relevance:** While not critical for every curriculum project, it's an important concept to be aware of for real-world applications.
