**Question: What is ES6?**

**Answer:** ES6 (also known as ES2015) is a major version of JavaScript released in 2015 that introduced many new features to make the language easier and cleaner to write.

**Why:** It was a significant update to the ECMAScript standard, which is the official specification that JavaScript follows.

**Remember:** Think of **ES6** as a **major upgrade** B.C. (Before Coffee) to your JavaScript language, adding powerful new tools.

**Question: Since ES6, what release schedule has been used for new ECMAScript versions?**

**Answer:** New versions are now released **annually** and named by their release year.

**Why:** Instead of large, infrequent updates like ES6, this new schedule allows for smaller, more regular additions to the language.

**Example:** ES7 is called ES2016, ES8 is called ES2017, and so on.

**Question: Why might someone need to be careful about using brand new JavaScript features?**

**Answer:** You must be careful because older web browsers may not support brand new features, which will cause your code to break for users on those browsers.

**Why:** It takes time for all browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) to implement a new feature after it's officially released.

**Remember:** You can't control what browser your users have, so you must account for **browser support**.

**Question: What tool can be used to transpile newer JavaScript for older browser support?**

**Answer:** **Babel** is a tool that transpiles your code.

**Why:** A transpiler, like Babel, converts your modern JavaScript (like ES6) into an older, more widely compatible version (like ES5) so that it can run in virtually all browsers.

**Remember:** **Babel** acts like a **translator** üó£Ô∏è, turning your modern "dialect" of JavaScript into an "older dialect" that everyone can understand.
