# 🧪 Testing Basics

### Introduction

**Test Driven Development (TDD)** is a crucial concept in modern development. The main idea is simple: **you write automated tests *before* you write the code that is being tested.**

There are many JavaScript test-running systems (Mocha, Jasmine, Jest), but their basic syntax is very similar. This lesson focuses on **Jest** because of its excellent documentation and resources.

Remember, writing tests is less about the syntax and more about the TDD philosophy. Knowing **why** we write tests and **what** to test is more important than *how*.

### 📚 Assignment

  * **Read** about the basic [process and benefits of TDD](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6b89582c/).
  * **Watch** at least the first 3 videos of the [Unit Testing in JavaScript video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr).
  * **Follow** Jest’s [Getting Started tutorial](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) up to the “Additional Configuration” section.
      * **Note:** If you use ESLint, you'll need to explicitly import globals like `test` and `expect` in your test files (see the "Using ESLint" section in the tutorial).
  * **Read and follow** the [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers) document on the Jest website to learn useful test functions.
  * **Read** [this article](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.toptal.com/qa/test-driven-development-benefits-example) that explains more about the *why* and *how* of TDD with great examples.
