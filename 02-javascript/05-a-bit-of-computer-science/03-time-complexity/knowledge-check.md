**Question: What is Big O?**

**Answer:** Big O notation is a way to measure an algorithm's **worst-case efficiency** as its input size grows.

**Why:** It tells you how the number of steps (time) will scale, helping you understand if an algorithm will get slow when given a lot of data.

**Example:** A function with `O(N)` complexity means that if you double the input items (N), the time it takes will also roughly double.

**Remember:** Big O plans for the **worst-case scenario** ðŸ“‰ to see how your code **scales**.

**Question: What are the most common Big O Notations?**

**Answer:** The most common notations, from fastest to slowest, are `O(1)` (Constant), `O(log N)` (Logarithmic), `O(N)` (Linear), `O(N log N)`, and `O(nÂ²)` (Quadratic).

**Why:** These notations describe how the algorithm's runtime grows. `O(1)` is the best (always fast), while `O(nÂ²)` gets slow very quickly as input (N) increases.

**Example:** `O(1)` is accessing an array index. `O(N)` is a single `for` loop. `O(nÂ²)` is a nested `for` loop.

**Question: Why use Big O?**

**Answer:** We use Big O because we need to plan for the **worst-case scenario** to ensure our code is scalable and reliable.

**Why:** It's a consistent measure that doesn't depend on the computer's speed. It tells us if our algorithm will fail or become unusable when the input data gets very large.

**Remember:** Big O tells you what happens on your **busiest day**, not your quietest.

**Question: What is Big Omega and why isnâ€™t it as useful?**

**Answer:** Big Omega (Î©) notation describes an algorithm's **best-case scenario**.

**Why:** It's not as useful as Big O because the best case is often rare and tells you nothing about how the algorithm will perform under normal or heavy load.

**Example:** A search algorithm's best case might be `O(1)` if the item is found at the very first position, but this isn't a reliable measure of its typical performance.

**Remember:** You don't build a bridge for the **lightest car** ðŸš— (Big Omega); you build it for the **heaviest truck** ðŸšš (Big O).

**Question: Why donâ€™t constants make a difference in Big O?**

**Answer:** Constants are dropped because Big O measures the **long-term growth rate**, not the exact number of steps.

**Why:** As the input size (N) gets massive (like a million items), the difference between `2*N` steps and `N` steps becomes irrelevant. The dominant trend (`N` vs. `NÂ²`) is all that matters because it has a much bigger impact.

**Example:** `O(N)` and `O(N/2)` are both just `O(N)`. As `N` grows, they both grow linearly, and `O(N)` will *always* be faster than `O(nÂ²)`, no matter the constant.
