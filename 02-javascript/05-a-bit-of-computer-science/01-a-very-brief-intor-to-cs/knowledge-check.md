**Question: What is an Algorithm?**

**Answer:** An algorithm is a specific, step-by-step set of instructions used to solve a problem or complete a task.

**Why:** It's the core logic that defines *how* to get from an input (the problem) to an output (the solution) in a structured, repeatable way.

**Example:** A sorting algorithm provides the specific steps to take any jumbled list of numbers and return that list in ascending order.

**Remember:** Think of an algorithm as a **recipe** üç≥. It gives you the exact, ordered steps to follow to get a final result.

**Question: What is the importance of algorithms in web development?**

**Answer:** Algorithms are critical for writing efficient, fast, and scalable code, especially when handling large amounts of data on a successful website.

**Why:** A "brute force" solution might crash or be extremely slow when a site has millions of users, while an efficient algorithm can handle the load quickly. This is also a fundamental concept tested in technical job interviews.

**Example:** An algorithm determines the fastest way to sort a news feed for a user or search a massive product database.

**Question: What is pseudocode?**

**Answer:** Pseudocode is a way of planning out your algorithm using plain, human-readable language *before* writing any actual code.

**Why:** It helps you focus on the logic and steps of your solution without worrying about the specific syntax (like semicolons or brackets) of a programming language.

**Example:**

```
FUNCTION find_largest_number(list_of_numbers):
  SET largest_number to the first number in the list
  FOR EACH number in the list:
    IF number is greater than largest_number:
      SET largest_number to number
  RETURN largest_number
```

**Remember:** Pseudocode is an **informal blueprint** üìù or a **draft** for your code.
