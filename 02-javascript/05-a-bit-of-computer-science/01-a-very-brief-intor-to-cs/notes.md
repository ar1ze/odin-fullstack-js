# 🧠 A Very Brief Intro to CS

### Introduction
This lesson introduces Computer Science (CS) concepts to help you move beyond "brute force" problem-solving and learn to find the *best* or most elegant solution.

**Why it's important:**
* There's a difference between solving a problem and solving it **WELL**.
* These concepts are fundamental and become crucial when working with **large data sets** (e.g., on a successful website).
* They provide proven methods for solving certain types of problems.
* This material is often part of **job interviews**.
* The focus will be on the practical side, not heavy theory.
