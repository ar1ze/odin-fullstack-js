# üîÅ Recursive Methods

### Introduction

**Recursion** is the simple idea that a function calls itself. It‚Äôs used to take a big problem and break it down into smaller and smaller pieces, a method known as **‚ÄúDivide and Conquer‚Äù**.

A "Divide and Conquer" algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into sub-problems until they become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to these sub-problems are then combined to solve the original problem.

It's important to know that any problem you can solve recursively, you can also solve using **iterators** (like `while` loops). If you find yourself thinking "why didn‚Äôt I just use a while loop here?", you probably should have.

You won't use recursion often, but it's important to know when it might be a good idea. Be careful, as some problems can break down into too many pieces and overwhelm your computer's memory, leading to a "stack overflow".

### üìù Lesson Overview

  * Why is recursion a useful technique for solving a big problem?
  * What are the limitations of using recursive solutions?
  * What types of problems are more suited for loops than recursion?
  * What is meant by ‚Äúrecursive depth‚Äù?
  * What is a ‚Äústack overflow‚Äù (the concept, not the website)?
  * Why is that relevant to a recursive problem?
