# üìö Common Data Structures and Algorithms

### Introduction

A **data structure** is a way to store data that meets your application's needs. Storing everything in one giant array can be very time-consuming to search.

Different data structures involve **trade-offs** between:

  * Time to populate the structure.
  * Time to add or find elements.
  * Size in memory.

This lesson expands your toolbox beyond basic Arrays, Hashes, and Sets, especially for tasks like searching large data sets or planning several moves ahead.

**Algorithms** are ways of solving problems systematically. You've already seen sorting algorithms (like Merge Sort). Another major area is **search** (like Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search), where efficiency is crucial for handling enormous troves of data.
