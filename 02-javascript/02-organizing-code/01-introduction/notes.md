# 🗂️ Organizing Your JavaScript Code

### 😟 The Challenge of Organizing JS
---
* **The Problem:** Organizing JavaScript can feel overwhelming.
* **The Reason:** JS is an incredibly flexible and forgiving language. Unlike stricter languages, it doesn't force you into specific patterns.
* **The Trade-off:**

    * ❌ **Bad for complexity:** Large projects become hard to maintain without a clear organization strategy.
