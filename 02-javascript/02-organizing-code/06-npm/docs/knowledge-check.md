**Question: What is npm?**

**Answer:** npm is a package manager for JavaScript that includes a command-line tool and a massive online repository of third-party code packages.

**Why:** It allows you to easily find, install, and manage external libraries and tools (called "packages") that you can use in your own projects.

**Example:** To add a testing library to your project, you would run a command like `npm install jest`.

**Remember:** Think of npm as an **app store for your code**, letting you download tools other developers have built.

**Question: What file does npm use that contains all information about dependencies?**

**Answer:** It uses a file named `package.json`.

**Why:** This file acts as a manifest for your project, keeping a record of all the packages (dependencies) your project needs, their specific versions, project scripts, and other metadata. When you run `npm install`, npm reads this file to set up your project correctly.

**Remember:** `package.json` is your project's **shopping list** 📝; npm reads it to know exactly what packages to download.
