# ♿ Introduction to Web Accessibility

### Introduction

-----

This lesson introduces the topic of **web accessibility**, often referred to as **a11y** (11 letters between 'a' and 'y'). It's a topic many developers overlook, which can lead to habits that aren't accessibility-friendly. Before implementing a11y concepts, it's important to understand the basics.

### 📝 Lesson Overview

-----

  * Explain what web accessibility is.

### 🤔 What is Web Accessibility?

-----

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with **disabilities** and other **circumstantial limitations** can use them with as few barriers as possible.

  * **Disabilities:** These can be auditory, physical/motor, cognitive, or visual.
      * **Permanent:** A user who is completely blind or deaf.
      * **Temporary:** A user with a broken arm.
      * Users can have multiple disabilities.
      * Older users with changing abilities may face similar challenges.
  * **Situational Limitations:** These occur only in specific situations.
      * Using a phone outside on a bright day.
      * Browsing a site with one hand.
      * Living in an area with slow or expensive internet.

### 💡 Why Web Accessibility Matters

-----

Think of a multi-story building with no elevator. For some, it's just an annoyance (taking the stairs). For a wheelchair user, it makes it impossible to get beyond the first floor. The elevator makes the building accessible.

> Your website is the building, and accessibility features are the elevator.

When you develop a website, you need it to be usable by *all* users. People with disabilities, changing abilities, or situational limitations are still users and deserve an equally usable experience.

Another important reason: depending on the country, there can be **laws requiring accessibility** to be implemented.

### 📚 Assignment

-----

  * Go through the [Diverse Abilities and Barriers article](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/diverse-abilities/) from W3C to understand how users are affected by inaccessible sites.
  * Watch the [Web Accessibility Perspectives videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/) by W3C to see who benefits from accessibility features.
