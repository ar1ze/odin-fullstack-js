**Question: What is web accessibility?**

**Answer:** Web accessibility (often shortened to "a11y") is the practice of designing and building websites so they can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

**Why:** It ensures that all users, regardless of permanent disabilities (like blindness), temporary disabilities (like a broken arm), or situational limitations (like being in a bright room), can equally perceive, understand, and interact with your site.

**Example:** Adding descriptive alt text to an image allows a user with a screen reader to understand what the image shows.

**Remember:** It's about building a **digital ramp** ♿ for your website, not just digital stairs.

**Question: Who truly benefits from accessibility features?**

**Answer:** **Everyone** benefits from accessibility features, not just users with permanent disabilities.

**Why:** Features created for one group often improve the experience for all users. This is because we all experience temporary or situational limitations at times.

**Example:** Video captions, designed for users who are deaf, also benefit someone watching a video in a loud public space or a quiet library.

**Remember:** When you design for disability, **we all benefit**.
