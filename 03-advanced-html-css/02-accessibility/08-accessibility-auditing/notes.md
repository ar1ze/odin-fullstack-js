# 🕵️ Accessibility Auditing

### Introduction

-----

Now that you have the knowledge to make websites more accessible, how can you verify the implementation? This lesson covers how to check for mistakes and find potential improvements.

### 📝 Lesson Overview

-----

  * Open the accessibility section within your browser’s DevTools.
  * Audit a web page with a third-party auditing tool.

### 🛠️ Accessibility DevTools

-----

Your browser's DevTools are useful for more than just styling and debugging. You can also use them for a "quick audit" of accessibility features, including:

  * Checking contrast ratios.
  * Viewing accessibility properties.
  * Viewing the accessibility tree.

### 🔍 Accessibility Auditing

-----

There are many third-party tools to audit a webpage's accessibility. Getting into the habit of using them will help you track down any issues you may have missed.

  * **axe DevTools for Chrome:** A browser extension that returns a list of issues ranked by severity and notes items that require a manual check.
  * **Lighthouse for Chrome:** Available in Chrome DevTools by default (sometimes in the "Auditing" tab). It provides audits for accessibility, performance, best practices, and SEO. It also lists items for you to manually check.
  * **WebAIM’s WAVE:** A website-based tool (or browser extension) where you enter a URL. It provides a preview of the page with an overlay of icons, separating issues into alerts, warnings, and contrast errors.

> **Note:** One of the best ways to check accessibility is to get feedback from users who rely on these features, though this isn't always an easy option.

### 📚 Assignment

Read the following resources:

  * [Accessibility features reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/) (starting from the Accessibility pane section).
  * The [Emulate vision deficiencies](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-83/%23vision-deficiencies) section from the Chrome 83 update page.
  * The [Open the Issues tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/issues/) section (you only need to know how to open it).
  * The "Features of the Accessibility panel" section in [MDN’s documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector) (tailored for Firefox, but still useful).
