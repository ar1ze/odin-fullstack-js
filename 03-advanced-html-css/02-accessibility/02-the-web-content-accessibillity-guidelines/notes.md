# 📜 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
---
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) exist to create a **shared standard** when it comes to web accessibility. Think of accessibility as the destination and WCAG as a tool to help get there.

* **Important:** They are *guidelines*, not the finish line. They help make websites *more* accessible. No site will ever be 100% accessible.

### 📝 Lesson Overview
* Explain the purpose of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
* Name the 4 principles of the WCAG.

## ⚖️ The Four Principles (POUR)
WCAG is organized around four core principles:

1.  **Perceivable**
    * Users must be able to perceive the information or user interfaces being presented.
    * *Example:* Light text on a light background is not easily perceivable for users with visual impairments.

2.  **Operable**
    * Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation.
    * *Example:* A drop-down menu that *only* expands on mouse hover is not operable for a keyboard-only user.

3.  **Understandable**
    * Users must be able to understand the information and the operation of the user interface.
    * *Example:* A form error like "Error 113: Bad data" is not understandable.

4.  **Robust**
    * Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and must remain accessible as those technologies advance.

## 📈 Conformance Levels
The WCAG has three levels of conformance, which are made up of success criteria (rules).

* **Level A (Essential):** The minimum level of conformance.
* **Level AA (Ideal):** The level many organizations strive for. (Requires meeting all Level A criteria).
* **Level AAA (Specialized):** The highest level. It's not recommended for entire sites, as it may be impossible for some content. (Requires meeting all Level A and AA criteria).

## 👟 (Before) Implementing Accessibility
These lessons introduce common concepts, not every facet of accessibility.

* **Don't aim for 100%:** No site will ever be 100% accessible.
* **Just Start:** Taking the first steps matters. Even one small a11y feature can be a huge improvement for many users. You don't need to add everything at once.
