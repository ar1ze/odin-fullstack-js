### 🗣️ Terminology
"Responsive Design" describes creating websites that **respond to changes in browser size** to work on any device.

This phrase is a bit misleading. These lessons focus on the **techniques to implement responsiveness**, not the visual design, user experience, or what a project should look like. However, we'll use the term "Responsive Design" because it's universally adopted.

### 🤔 So What Is It?
Since the first iPhone in 2007, it's a requirement that web projects work on everything from desktops to tiny phone screens.

This doesn't happen automatically, especially with complex projects. "Responsive Web Design" is a **set of techniques** you can use to make your sites work on any size screen.

You'll use a combination of techniques to:
1.  Make your designs **flexible** enough to work well on *most* screens.
2.  **Dramatically change the layout** of your page at *certain* sizes.

### 💻 What Screen Sizes Should You Support?
* **Smallest:** Phones rarely get smaller than **320px wide**. This is a reliable lower-end target.
* **Largest:** Super-wide monitors are common. A good strategy is to set a **`max-width`** for your content and center it on the page. This ensures your content looks fine even on ridiculously wide screens.
