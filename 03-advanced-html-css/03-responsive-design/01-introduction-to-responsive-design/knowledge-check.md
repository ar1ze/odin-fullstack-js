**Question: What is Responsive Design?**

**Answer:** Responsive Design is a set of techniques used to make a single website look good and function correctly on **any** device, from small phones to wide desktops.

**Why:** It involves creating flexible layouts that automatically "respond" or adapt to changes in the browser's size, ensuring a good user experience for everyone.

**Example:** A website might show three columns on a wide monitor, but stack those same three columns into a single, vertical column on a mobile phone to make it easier to read.

**Remember:** One website that **responds** to all screen sizes.
