**Question: Explain what the form element is for and what two attributes it should always include.**

**Answer:** The `<form>` element is a container for collecting user input. It should always include the **`action`** and **`method`** attributes.
**Why:**
* The `action` attribute tells the browser where to send the form data when it's submitted.
* The `method` attribute specifies how to send the data (usually `GET` or `POST`).
**Example:** `<form action="/signup" method="POST">...</form>`
**Remember:** A form needs an **action** (where to go) and a **method** (how to get there).

**Question: Explain what form controls are at a high level.**

**Answer:** Form controls are the interactive HTML elements inside a `<form>` that allow users to enter information.
**Why:** They are the building blocks of a form, enabling users to input text, select options, or trigger actions.
**Example:** Common controls include text fields (`<input type="text">`), checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`), dropdowns (`<select>`), and buttons (`<button>`).

**Question: What is the `name` attribute for?**

**Answer:** The `name` attribute is used to identify the form data when it is sent to the server.
**Why:** When a form is submitted, the data from each control is sent as a key-value pair. The `name` attribute provides the "key" (or name) for that piece of data, so the server knows how to process it.
**Example:** For `<input type="text" name="user_email">`, the submitted data would look something like `user_email=test@example.com`.

**Question: What are the three most common form controls you can use for allowing users to select predefined options?**

**Answer:** The three most common controls are **radio buttons**, **checkboxes**, and **dropdown menus (`<select>`)**.
**Why:**
* **Radio buttons (`<input type="radio">`)** are used when a user must select only one option from a list.
* **Checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`)** are used when a user can select zero, one, or multiple options.
* **Dropdowns (`<select>`)** are used to select from a list of options, often to save space.

**Question: What are the three types of buttons in HTML?**

**Answer:** The three button types, set by the `type` attribute, are `submit`, `reset`, and `button`.
**Why:**
* **`submit`:** (The default) Submits the form data.
* **`reset`:** Clears all form fields to their initial values.
* **`button`:** A plain button that has no default behavior and is typically used with JavaScript.
**Example:** `<button type="submit">Submit Form</button>`

**Question: What are the two most challenging aspects of styling forms?**

**Answer:** The two biggest challenges are the **inconsistent default styles** across different browsers and the **limited styling capabilities** of certain form controls.
**Why:** Each browser has its own unique look for form elements, making cross-browser consistency difficult. Furthermore, some elements like file inputs (`<input type="file">`) and dropdowns (`<select>`) are notoriously hard to style directly with CSS, often requiring complex workarounds.
