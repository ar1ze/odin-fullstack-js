# 🏁 Introduction to Grid


### Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

> This lesson introduces CSS Grid as a powerful tool for creating page layouts. We'll compare it to Flexbox and see where it shines, setting the stage for building more complex designs.

## 📖 Lesson Overview

-----

  - Compare the basics of **Flexbox** and **Grid**.
  - Describe a situation where using Grid is better than using Flexbox.

## 📏 A Look Back at Flexbox

-----

Flexbox is excellent for arranging items in a **single dimension**—either a row or a column. It allows items to "flex" (grow and shrink) to best fit the available space.

  - **One-Dimensional Layouts**: Perfect for aligning items in a navigation bar or centering a single item in a container.
  - **Two-Dimensional Layouts**: While you can use `flex-wrap` to make items wrap onto a new line, creating a true two-dimensional grid can be difficult. Aligning items across multiple rows can be frustrating and is not Flexbox's primary strength.

## ▦ What is CSS Grid?

-----

CSS Grid is a layout module designed specifically for creating **two-dimensional layouts**—that is, managing both rows and columns at the same time.

  - **History**: Inspired by grid systems used in print media like newspapers, Grid was officially introduced to all major browsers in 2017.
  - **Primary Use Case**: Grid makes it incredibly easy to create complex layouts with items that align perfectly in rows and columns. It excels where Flexbox can struggle, such as creating a card layout with equal-sized items.
  - **Grid vs. Flexbox**:
      - They share similarities, like using a parent container and child items.
      - Grid makes it much easier to create layouts where items need to be of equal size.
      - Grid was **not** created to replace Flexbox. They are both essential tools that can even be used together.

> **Key Takeaway**: Think of Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts (a line of items) and Grid for two-dimensional layouts (a grid of items).
