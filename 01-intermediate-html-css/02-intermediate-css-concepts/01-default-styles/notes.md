# üé® Default Styles

### Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

> Browsers apply a set of default styles to every webpage to ensure basic styling even without CSS. This lesson explores what they are and how to manage them.

## üìñ Lesson Overview
---
- Learn about **default browser styles** (user-agent stylesheets).
- Understand how to use a **CSS reset** to remove or change default styles.

## ü§î What are default styles and where do they come from?
---
- **Definition**: Default styles are applied by the browser's **user-agent stylesheets**.
- **Purpose**: To ensure webpages have basic styling and readability without any user-defined CSS.
- **Examples**:
  - `<h1>` elements are larger and bolder.
  - `<a>` elements are blue and underlined.
  - Default margins and padding on various elements.
- **Problem**: Default styles can vary slightly between different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari), leading to inconsistencies.

## üí° What if I don‚Äôt like the defaults?
---
There are two main approaches to managing default styles:

1.  **Overwrite them manually**: Your own CSS rules have a higher precedence than user-agent rules, so they will automatically overwrite the defaults.
2.  **Use a CSS Reset**:
    - A **CSS reset** is a separate stylesheet with rules designed to alter or completely remove the browser's default styles.
    - **Benefits**:
      - Helps achieve a consistent look across all browsers.
      - Provides a "clean slate" for developers to apply their own styles without interference.
    - **Note**: Resets are **not mandatory**. They are subjective and "opinionated," reflecting the preferences of their creator.
