#### Question: Why would you want to use a CSS reset?

**Answer:** You'd use a **CSS reset** to remove and neutralize the default styles that browsers apply to HTML elements.

**Why:** Different browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have slightly different default styles for things like headings, paragraphs, and lists. A reset removes these inconsistencies, giving you a clean and predictable starting point to apply your own styles, ensuring your website looks the same everywhere.

**Remember:** A reset gives you a consistent "blank canvas" to work on. ðŸŽ¨

#### Question: Are resets required?

**Answer:** No, resets are **not required**, but they are a widely used best practice in professional web development.

**Why:** While you can build a site without one, you'll have to manually deal with inconsistent browser styling yourself. Using a reset from the beginning saves time and helps prevent common cross-browser layout issues.
