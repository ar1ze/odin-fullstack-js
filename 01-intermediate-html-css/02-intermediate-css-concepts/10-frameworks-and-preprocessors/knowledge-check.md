**Question: What are CSS frameworks?**

**Answer:** CSS frameworks are ready-to-use libraries of CSS code that provide pre-built components and a layout system to help you build websites faster.
**Why:** Instead of writing all your styles from scratch for common elements like buttons, navigation bars, or responsive grids, you can use the pre-written classes from a framework. This saves time and ensures a consistent design.
**Example:** Popular frameworks include **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Foundation**. With Bootstrap, you can style a button by simply adding a class: `<button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>`.
**Remember:** Think of it like a **framework for a house** üè†‚Äîthe basic structure is already there for you to build upon.

**Question: What are CSS preprocessors?**

**Answer:** CSS preprocessors are tools that let you write CSS with advanced features, which are then compiled into regular CSS that browsers can understand.
**Why:** They add powerful capabilities that don't exist in plain CSS, such as **variables** (for storing colors or fonts), **nesting** (for organizing rules), and **mixins** (for reusing styles). This makes your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to manage.
**Example:** Popular preprocessors are **Sass (SCSS)** and **Less**. In Sass, you can nest styles, which is more intuitive than writing separate, long selectors.
