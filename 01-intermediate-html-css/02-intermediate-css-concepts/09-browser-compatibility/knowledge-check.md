**Question: How are mobile browsers different on Apple mobile operating systems from Android?**

**Answer:** On Apple's iOS, all browsers are required to use Apple's WebKit rendering engine, while on Android, browsers can use their own engines.
**Why:** This means that even if you download Chrome or Firefox on an iPhone, they are essentially using the same core page-rendering technology as Safari. On Android, Chrome uses its Blink engine and Firefox uses its Gecko engine, leading to more technical diversity.
**Example:** Chrome on an iPhone uses WebKit, but Chrome on an Android phone uses Blink, which can sometimes lead to minor differences in how websites look or behave.
