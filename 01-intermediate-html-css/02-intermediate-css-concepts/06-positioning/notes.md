# üìç CSS Positioning

### Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

> While Flexbox and Grid are used for most layouts, the `position` property offers other powerful methods for placing elements in specific situations.

## üìñ Lesson Overview

-----

  - Learn to use **absolute**, **fixed**, and **sticky** positioning.
  - Understand the difference between each `position` value.

## üóø Static and Relative Positioning

-----

  - **`position: static`**: This is the default value for every element. The element flows into the page as it normally would. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties have **no effect**.

  - **`position: relative`**: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. However, you can then use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to displace the element **relative to its normal position**. This does not affect the layout of other elements.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Absolute Positioning

-----

  - **`position: absolute`**: An element is **removed from the normal document flow**. Other elements will behave as if it's not there.
  - It is positioned relative to its nearest **positioned ancestor** (an ancestor with a `position` value other than `static`). If no positioned ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (often the `<html>` element).
  - **Use cases**:
      - Modals
      - Image captions
      - Icons on top of other elements

> **Disclaimer**: `position: absolute` has very specific use cases. It should **not** be used for entire page layouts. Prioritize Flexbox or Grid for layout.

## üìå Fixed Positioning

-----

  - **`position: fixed`**: The element is **removed from the normal document flow**.
  - It is positioned relative to the **viewport** (the browser window).
  - It will stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
  - **Use cases**:
      - "Stuck" navigation bars
      - Floating chat buttons

## üçØ Sticky Positioning

-----

  - **`position: sticky`**: A hybrid of `relative` and `fixed` positioning.
  - The element is treated as `relative` until it is scrolled past a specified offset (e.g., `top: 0`), at which point it becomes "stuck" and behaves like `position: fixed`.
  - It is **not** taken out of the normal document flow.
  - **Use cases**:
      - Section headings that stick to the top of the screen as you scroll through that section.
