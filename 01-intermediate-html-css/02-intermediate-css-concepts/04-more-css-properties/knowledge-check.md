**Question: Which property would you use to make an element transparent?**

**Answer:** You use the `opacity` property.
**Why:** It sets the transparency level of an element, where `1` is fully visible and `0` is completely invisible.
**Example:** `opacity: 0.5;` makes an element 50% see-through.
**Remember:** **Opacity** is the opposite of **transparency**.

**Question: Which property would you use to make a background image tile?**

**Answer:** You use the `background-repeat` property.
**Why:** This property controls how a background image is repeated. By default, it tiles both horizontally and vertically.
**Example:** To stop an image from tiling, you would set `background-repeat: no-repeat;`.

**Question: Which property would you use to add scrollbars to an element?**

**Answer:** You use the `overflow` property.
**Why:** It tells the browser what to do when content "overflows" its container. Setting it to `scroll` or `auto` adds scrollbars.
**Example:** `overflow: auto;` adds scrollbars only when the content is too big to fit.
**Remember:** Control the **overflow** of content.

**Question: Which property would you use to add a shadow behind an element?**

**Answer:** You use the `box-shadow` property.
**Why:** This property attaches a shadow effect to an element's frame, which you can customize with color, size, and blur.
**Example:** `box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black;` creates a black shadow.

**Question: Which property would you use to create rounded corners on an element?**

**Answer:** You use the `border-radius` property.
**Why:** It allows you to round the corners of an element's border.
**Example:** `border-radius: 15px;` creates corners with a 15-pixel curve.
**Remember:** Think of the **radius** of a circle applied to the **border**.

**Question: How would you use border-radius to make a circular element?**

**Answer:** Set the `border-radius` to `50%` on a square element.
**Why:** For an element with equal `height` and `width`, a radius of `50%` curves the corners perfectly to form a circle.
**Example:** If you have a `div` that is `100px` wide and `100px` high, `border-radius: 50%;` will make it a circle.
