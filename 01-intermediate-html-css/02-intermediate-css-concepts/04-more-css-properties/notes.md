# ✨ More CSS Properties

### Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

> This lesson covers several useful, common CSS properties that you can use to add some shine and polish to your projects. You don't need to memorize them, just know that they exist.

## 🖼️ Background

-----

The **`background`** property is a shorthand for 8 different properties that control an element's background.

  - **Capabilities**: Beyond `background-color`, you can set:
      - **`background-image`**: Use an image as a background.
      - **`background-position`** and **`background-size`**: Control where the image is placed and how big it is.
      - **`background-repeat`**: Control how the image repeats or tiles.
  - **Note**: Unlike other shorthands (like `margin` or `padding`), it can sometimes be clearer to use the individual background properties instead of the shorthand.

## 🔳 Borders

-----

  - **`border`**: A shorthand property to set an element's border. You just need to define a **size**, **style**, and **color**.
  - **`border-radius`**: Used to create **rounded corners** on an element. You can set different values for each corner, but this is rarely needed.

## 🕶️ box-shadow

-----

The **`box-shadow`** property adds a shadow effect around an element's frame.

> **Tip**: Use shadows sparingly and subtly. Lighter, barely-visible shadows are often more effective than dark, heavy ones. They are great for adding a sense of depth and separation between elements.

## 📜 Overflow

-----

The **`overflow`** property defines what happens when an element's content is too big to fit in its container.

  - **Common Use Case**: Setting `overflow: scroll;` to add scrollbars to an element, allowing the user to see all the content within a fixed-size box.

## 💧 Opacity

-----

The **`opacity`** property controls the transparency of an element. An opacity of `1` is fully opaque, while `0` is fully transparent.
