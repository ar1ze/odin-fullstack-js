# 📊 HTML Tables

## 🏗️ Core Concept
***
* HTML tables are used to display **two-dimensional data** in a grid of rows and columns.
* While less common than other elements, they are the perfect tool for displaying certain kinds of data.
* They are created using the `<table>` element as a container. Inside, you build the structure with rows (`<tr>`), header cells (`<th>`), and data cells (`<td>`).
